# THE STABILITY ENGINE: HOW IT WORKS
**Purpose:** To ensure our system is balanced and safe using simple math [cite: 2026-01-21].

## 1. The Three Rules of Balance
Instead of complex codes, we use three numbers to check if the system is "healthy":
* **The Foundation (3):** This checks if the basic structure is solid [cite: 2026-01-21].
* **The Flow (6):** This checks if information is moving smoothly through the system [cite: 2026-01-21].
* **The Balance (9):** This is our target. It means everything is working together perfectly [cite: 2026-01-21].

## 2. The Quality Test
Every time we run a calculation, the "Stability Engine" gives us a percentage score:
* **Above 95%:** The system is **STABLE**. We can move forward safely.
* **Below 95%:** The system is **UNSTABLE**. We stop and fix the problem before continuing.

## 3. Why This Works
By using these simple rules, we don't need a "black box" to tell us if a project is safe [cite: 2026-01-21]. We can see the balance for ourselves, ensuring that the Human Operator always understands the "Why" behind the "What".
