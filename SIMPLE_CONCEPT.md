# THE HYBRID AXIS: HOW IT WORKS (Simple Version)

Imagine we are building a high-tech house. To make sure it is safe, we follow four simple steps:

## 1. The Gravity Rule (Turing_Landau)
We cannot build something that defies physics. The system first checks if the idea is realistic and solid in the real world.

## 2. Learning from the Past (Anamnesis)
We look at old blueprints and past mistakes. If a similar project failed before, the system warns us so we don't repeat the same error.

## 3. The Storm Test (Zoo_Entropic)
Before we build, we simulate a giant storm. If the virtual house falls down, we fix the plan. We only build what is 100% stable.

## 4. Clear Blueprints (Lambda)
No secret codes. Everything is explained in simple words so the owner knows exactly what the machine is doing [cite: 2026-01-21].

## 5. The Final Key (The Vault)
The machine does the math, but the Human is the Inspector. Nothing happens without the Human's final signature.
